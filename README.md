# OpenThread on SAMR21 Example

This repo contains example platform drivers for the [Microchip ATSAMR21G18A][samr21] based on [SAM R21 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit][samr21_xplained_pro].

[samr21]: http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMR21G18A
[samr21_xplained_pro]: https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMR21-XPRO

The example platform drivers are intended to present the minimal code necessary to support OpenThread. See the "Run the example with SAMR21 boards" section below for an example using basic OpenThread capabilities.

## Toolchain

Download and install the [GNU toolchain for ARM Cortex-M][gnu-toolchain].

[gnu-toolchain]: https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

In a Bash terminal, follow these instructions to install the GNU toolchain and other dependencies.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-samr21>
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

## Building

1. Download [Advanced Software Framework (ASF)][asf].

[asf]: https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/advanced-software-framework

2. Unzip it to <path-to-ot-samr21>/third_party/microchip folder

```bash
$ unzip asf-standalone-archive-3.45.0.85.zip
$ cp xdk-asf-3.45.0 -rf <path-to-ot-samr21>/third_party/microchip/asf
```

3. Build OpenThread Firmware (CLI example) on SAMR21 platform.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-samr21>
$ ./script/build
```

## Flash Binaries

After a successful build, the `elf` files are found in `<path-to-ot-samr21>/build/bin/`.

Compiled binaries may be flashed onto the SAM R21 Xplained Pro using embedded debugger EDBG.

```bash
$ openocd -f board/atmel_samr21_xplained_pro.cfg
$ cd <path-to-ot-samr21>/output/samr21/bin
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb ot-cli-ftd
$ (gdb) target remote 127.0.0.1:3333
$ (gdb) load
$ (gdb) monitor reset
$ (gdb) c
```

## Interact

1. Open terminal to `/dev/ttyUSB1` (serial port settings: 115200 8-N-1).
2. Type `help` for list of commands.
3. See [OpenThread CLI Reference README.md][cli] to learn more.
